_Work Portfolio Website_

Hi! This is the source-code for my portfolio website. An archive of work projects and information on hiring.

## About the repository

This repository is currently in the staging phase, awaiting its public launch. I haven't told anybody about this yet, so if you're here, hello you lucky person!

I made this website using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).  
You can run/build the source using the standard commands in their docks. I've also configured a few scripts for convenience.

`npm run dev`: Runs 11ty in a development server, no other build systems are necessary!

`npm run build`: Builds the site into `_site` directory.

`npm run clean-build`: Deletes the current `_site` directory and builds a freshie!
