_Work Portfolio Website_

Hi! This is the source-code for my portfolio website. An archive of work projects and information on hiring.

## About the repository

This repository is currently private, but will be open sourced on launch. If you're reading this, hello time traveler!

I made this website using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).  
You can run/build the source using the standard commands in their docks. I've also configured a few scripts for convenience.

`npm run dev`: Runs 11ty in a development server, no other build systems are necessary!

`npm run build`: Builds the site into `_site` directory.

`npm run clean-build`: Deletes the current `_site` directory and builds a freshie!
