<p>Hi! This is the source-code for my portfolio website. An archive of work projects and information on hiring.</p>
<h2>About the repository</h2>
<p>This repository is currently private, but will be open sourced on launch. If you're reading this, hello time traveler!</p>
<p>I made this website using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eleventy</a>.<br>
You can run/build the source using the standard commands in their docks. I've also configured a few scripts for convenience.</p>
<p><code>npm run dev</code>: Runs 11ty in a development server, no other build systems are necessary!</p>
<p><code>npm run build</code>: Builds the site into <code>_site</code> directory.</p>
<p><code>npm run clean-build</code>: Deletes the current <code>_site</code> directory and builds a freshie!</p>
