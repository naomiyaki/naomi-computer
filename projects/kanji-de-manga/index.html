            <p>I first encountered the Kanji de Manga series as a college intern at Japanime/Manga University publishing. I'm not sure if I had seen the series before, but I felt like I had. As a teen, I wanted to learn Japanese in part so that I could read lots of Japanese comics. I used Japanese comics as a learning resource along the way - going over characters again and again until I could identify them, even if I didn't know what the text was saying yet.</p>
<p>Kanji de Manga does exactly this: teach a new character on each page with a purposefully written comic, so that the reader can advance and eventually read Japanese comics on their own. It was as if the book's existence validated my desire and way of learning, and working with the company showed me that I wasn't alone at all.</p>

<p>My first work on the Kanji de Manga series, as an intern, was on volume 4 as a translation checker. When I came back to work at Japanime in 2007, I became the layout/graphics person and translator on the series. For volumes 1-4, the books were made in Adobe Illustrator, with separate vector files for every single page. One of my first jobs was to port the layout from Adobe Illustrator to Adobe's book layout program InDesign, which made editing and updating the book dramatically easier. The new layout also helped us export the book for Kindle and other e-readers, which were just starting to come out at the time.</p>

<p>Each character page has a structured template with example words that use the character, a stroke-order diagram (how to write the character with a pen or brush), and the comic with its translation.</p>
<p>I remember that when I joined the company, comics artist Chihiro Hattori had already written and sketched most of the comics for volume 5. I translated the comics with help from Mari Ooyama, the company manager/accountant who is a native Japanese speaker. Glenn Kardy, the CEO and series creator would always edit my translations after, making the wording snappier and more natural.</p>
<p>For series 6, we were able to jump right in with the InDesign template from the last one and do it all over again with 80 more Kanji characters!</p>
