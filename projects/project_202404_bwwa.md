In 2022 my friend Hazel Newlevant asked me about putting together a story for a possible comic anthology: It's like a kids book with cool, real-life role models that are all trans!

When I came out in 2009 there were I think 2 books that included trans people in the St. Paul bookstore with the LGBTQ section (it would have been called a "gay and lesbian" or "sexuality" section at the time). The books were dense, adult, and focused almost entirely on the details of transition. I knew one other out trans person. Where were the cool trans people out in the world for me to look up to?

Hopefully, this is something people have to ask less and less. I hope this book is a part of that.

Becoming Who We Are is a comic anthology featuring 9 stories about different trans people who have done and are doing amazing things in the world. Each story is also drawn by a different trans comic artist! I drew a story about **Robbi Mecus**. Robbi is a rock/ice climbing forest ranger who rescues people in areas like the Adirondak mountains.

The story, which was written by the great Lilah Sturges and project director Ana Joanes, focuses on her upbringing and discovery of her athletecism and rock climbing.
I got to do a lot of research and learn a lot about Robbi to make this comic. Ana had started with a lengthy video interview, and there are fortunately quite a few articles from and about Robbi online. If you haven't heard it, I was really inspired by this interview of her on NPR (urr, wait till after you read the book!!). I had never drawn rock-climbing before, and didn't even know what the equipment looked like. I went and did it!

The initial scene is a bike-chase through the streets of Greenpoint Brooklyn in the 1970s. To figure out the composition (and architecture!) for each panels in this scene, I built a mini 3D scene using older buildings from the area.
