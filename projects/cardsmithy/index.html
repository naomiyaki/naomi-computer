            <p>Cardsmithy is a roguelike deckbuilding game about forging weapons to fight back the scourge(s) that have appeared on the shores of Rylan. That is, until you find out why these creatures and curses are here in the first place, hmm! I worked on the project as the art-director, asset artist, UI designer, and sometimes writer until the studio closed in Summer of 2023.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All things considered, it's been a peaceful morning down at Saina Tan Ironworks, the most storied forge in Rylan, if not the only proper one left. It's usually going to be a chill day when you aren't awoken by the irate bleating of goats arguing over the last lush tuft of green. A couple of spoons in the hopper, and there's that railspike order, but you should be on track as long as you get 2 or 3 done today.</p>

<p>I joined the company in the prototyping stages and worked with the lead developer <a href="https://loganstolmaker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logan Stolmaker</a> to design the UI for crafting, which was to be the main loop of gameplay. The visual design process led to questions about the prototype: &quot;What are the main sources of conflict and gameplay friction?&quot; &quot;Can the crafting be modularized?&quot; We collaborated on the game design together for another couple of rounds, pursuing the mechanics and challenges that were the most fun each time.</p>

<p>Along the way, I started writing the lore of the game, so I could create a setting where we could build a visual language, places, character, and weapon designs.</p>
<p><figure class="content-image-with-caption"><picture><source type="image/png" srcset="05629o6cdc-720.png 720w, 05629o6cdc-1380.png 1380w" sizes="100%"><img title=" Concept art of the Boville Garrison watchtower, a farmland cow-themed town." alt="Grayscale drawing of a background from inside a watch-tower of the Boville garrison." class="content-image full-size" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="05629o6cdc-720.jpeg" width="1380" height="776" srcset="05629o6cdc-720.jpeg 720w, 05629o6cdc-1380.jpeg 1380w" sizes="100%"></picture><figcaption> Concept art of the Boville Garrison watchtower, a farmland cow-themed town.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><em>On your midday break some of your parent's old chums come by with a bundle of mountain-moss wood and the usual talk about &quot;don't let the forge languish with just nails and cutlery.&quot; Your parent, and all of Rylan, have a history of trading in some epic weaponry, but things are finally calm now. Sure, the mad-prince is off with most of the military and tradesfolk (not to mention your parent and older sibling) but imperial colony or not, Rylan is at its best when it's self governing. And the mad-prince didn't leave any replacement so... things have kinda' just gotten steady. Maybe even cozy.</em></p>
<p>Building the game's world was like creating a small atlas of places that didn't (yet) exist. We came up with a fantasy world and filled it with questions, many of which were answered by chracters and tools that could become quests for our player.</p>

<p><em>The wheels of your grandmother's old cart jolt and dig along the rocky road to Evertide: the keep suspended over the mouth of main-river. You don't need to go there directly, but usually after a delivery they let you take a small keg of hearty-ocean stew, reserved otherwise for tourists and dignitairies. Before your tummy has time to rest in hope, you catch someone bounding towards the cart from the keep. Seejan is as swift footed as a coyote (they're part coyote afterall), but their pace is frantic and clumsy - not at all like a prideful orderly of the keep.</em></p>

<p>I did a ton of research on black-smithing history and current practices for creating metal tools and weapons in different parts of the world. Almost every design was based on a real-world craft, so that the player felt like they were building something that could truly exist, even if it was a feantasy weapon. Another goal of the project was for it to be a video game world where queer characters just are, tons of them! Without the plot ever having to be about singling out a character's queerness or explaining it to a non-queer audience. I only got to design a few characters for the story so far, but I kept that goal in mind on every one.</p>

<p>When we hit a gameplay milestone, Logan and I would show it to the team, and then I'd share the prototype with my friend Emyriad. She can see and analyze card/deck building games like some kind of magic x-ray person. When it was a game she was excited to play, then I knew we were on the right track.</p>
<p>Sadly Cardsmithy wasn't finished before the studio producing it was closed. While I feel very lucky to have gotten the chance to work on it, truthfully I think it was a bit too big in scope for our first project to be making as a team.</p>

<p>Since the studio closed, Logan and I made <a href="/projects/no-gloop-no-glory/">another small game together</a>, and have continued to collaborate on future game ideas. We may come back to Cardsmithy one day, but in any case I hope we can continue to make strange and thoughtful games together.</p>
