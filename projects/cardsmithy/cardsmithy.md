Cardsmithy is a roguelike deckbuilding game about forging weapons to fight back the scourge(s) that have appeared on the shores of Rylan. That is, until you find out why these creatures and curses are here in the first place, hmm! I worked on the project as the art-director, asset artist, UI designer, and sometimes writer until the studio closed in Summer of 2023.

> All things considered, it's been a peaceful morning down at Saina Tan Ironworks, the most storied forge in Rylan, if not the only proper one left. It's usually going to be a chill day when you aren't awoken by the irate bleating of goats arguing over the last lush tuft of green. A couple of spoons in the hopper, and there's that railspike order, but you should be on track as long as you get 2 or 3 done today.

I joined the company in the prototyping stages and worked with the lead developer [Logan Stolmaker](https://loganstolmaker.com/) to design the UI for crafting, which was to be the main loop of gameplay. The visual design process led to questions about the prototype: "What are the main sources of conflict and gameplay friction?" "Can the crafting be modularized?" We collaborated on the game design together for another couple of rounds, pursuing the mechanics and challenges that were the most fun each time.

Three metaphorical rows point down towards the sword like in a rhythm game. Different icons of a flame, a broken sword, and a pair of goggles rest on each row.](flat-prototype.jpg 'An early hand-drawn "flat" prototype of the crafting screen, before integrating any 3D elements')

Along the way, I started writing the lore of the game, so I could create a setting where we could build a visual language, places, character, and weapon designs.

_On your midday break some of your parent's old chums come by with a bundle of mountain-moss wood and the usual talk about "don't let the forge languish with just nails and cutlery." Your parent, and all of Rylan, have a history of trading in some epic weaponry, but things are finally calm now. Sure, the mad-prince is off with most of the military and tradesfolk (not to mention your parent and older sibling) but imperial colony or not, Rylan is at its best when it's self governing. And the mad-prince didn't leave any replacement so... things have kinda' just gotten steady. Maybe even cozy._

Building the game's world was like creating a small atlas of places that didn't (yet) exist. We came up with a fantasy world and filled it with questions, many of which were answered by characters and tools that could become quests for our player.

It's a coastal area with the ocean to the east and a river running through the middle of the land through the ocean. 5 areas are outlined with dotted lines.](map-rylan.jpg 'I drew this map to help create/understand the geographic regions/features of Rylan. We also started experimented with 3D models for in-game map locations')

_The wheels of your grandmother's old cart jolt and dig along the rocky road to Evertide: the keep suspended over the mouth of main-river. You don't need to go there directly, but usually after a delivery they let you take a small keg of hearty-ocean stew, reserved otherwise for tourists and dignitairies. Before your tummy has time to rest in hope, you catch someone bounding towards the cart from the keep. Seejan is as swift footed as a coyote (they're part coyote afterall), but their pace is frantic and clumsy - not at all like a prideful orderly of the keep._

![Black and white concept sketches of several in-game weapons or tools. In some of these, there is a version of the weapon that is broken up into different parts (for instance the blade/tang and handle) and some are whole pieces.](weapons.jpg 'From left to right: A hatchet, a poleaxe separated and together, and two more hatchets. Translucent in the back is a big ulu - which is a multipurpose chopping tool used by the Inuit, Iñupiat, Yupik, and Aleut peoples, and a leuku which is a crafting/butchering knife used by the Sámi people.')

I did a ton of research on black-smithing history and current practices for creating metal tools and weapons in different parts of the world. Almost every design was based on a real-world craft, so that the player felt like they were building something that could truly exist, even if it was a feantasy weapon. Another goal of the project was for it to be a video game world where queer characters just are, tons of them! Without the plot ever having to be about singling out a character's queerness or explaining it to a non-queer audience. I only got to design a few characters for the story so far, but I kept that goal in mind on every one.

![Concept of two different characters, Seejan and Lyric. Seejan is showen with two different haircuts and outfits, and in one concept is a coyote/furry type character. One outfit is more cloak/dress like, one is more of a young butler/orderly outfit, and the coyote one is more of a restaurant server's or cooks outfit. Lyric is a forager wit a large build. She has l;long, bushy hair held with a bandana, a big bag and a shoulder sling with some foraging tools. Lyric is shown doing a plain A-pose, one where she is bounding to the left, and one from behind where she is sitting and gathering or pruning something.](characters.jpg '@class[full-size]')

_You don't know Seejan to panic like this, but you still don't want to believe what they say. A haunted army climbing the wingwall to the keep? The garden staff has been cursed by a phantom lily? An unknown creature rising from the ocean? What are... what is **anyone** supposed to do about that? And why is it happening?
The hoof-print of a Saina Tan burned into the wooden lid of your cargo catches your eye. Your grandmother's maker's mark. Your parent's maker's mark. What will you make now?

![User interface kit for Cardsmithy. It looks like an old piece of paper with folded and uneven edges, but it's a rich dark brown with elegant technical borders that look like they're part of a diagram for something almost mechanical. There are sample UI elements for an inset border, a text input, and two buttosn (one big and one small). The buttons have sample hover states where they are kind of "grabbed" by metalic, plant like shapes.](ui_paper-kit.png)

![Playable in game prototype of the Leuku crafting screen. The knife is separated into gray, 3D, handle and blade with an ornate blue and metalic panel in front of each part with crafting tasks to complete. The player has a hand of 5 cards with different color schemes.](tasks-prototype.jpg 'A later, more built-out playable prototype with animated, 3D crafting parts - modeled by Chris Petersen.')

When we hit a gameplay milestone, Logan and I would show it to the team, and then I'd share the prototype with my friend Emyriad. She can see and analyze card/deck building games like some kind of magic x-ray person. When it was a game she was excited to play, then I knew we were on the right track.

Sadly Cardsmithy wasn't finished before the studio producing it was closed. While I feel very lucky to have gotten the chance to work on it, truthfully I think it was a bit too big in scope for our first project to be making as a team.

![Icon with a round blue slime, almost gum-drop shaped. The slime has a face and they are looking nervous but resigned at the same time, almost embarassed a little bit, with a big sweat drop to the upper left of their large, glossy eyes.](../no-gloop-no-glory/gloop-icon.png '@class[thumb]')

Since the studio closed, Logan and I made [another small game together](/projects/no-gloop-no-glory/), and have continued to collaborate on future game ideas. We may come back to Cardsmithy one day, but in any case I hope we can continue to make strange and thoughtful games together.
