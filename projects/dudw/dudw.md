Das Duell Um Die Welt "The Battle around the World" is a travel challenge television show that started in 2012. The show's theme is that the two friends Joko and Klaas send each other to do increasingly strange and difficult challenges around the world.

I worked on three episodes of Das Duell Um Die Welt (which is also sometimes called "DUDW," or "Joko Gegen Klaas (Joko vs. Klaas)) with [La Carmina and the Pirates](https://lacarmina.com/pirates/). The Pirates are a film-fixing and production crew, run by the fearless captain (and long-time friend) La Carmina.

Some of the city is peeking up in the background. Various crew, camera, and sound people are standing around in the mud and rocks to film them. One camera operator is not wearing shoes.](mund-behind-beach.jpg "La Carmina entering Joko Gegen Klaas' Canada episode")

This is a long one!! If you don't have time to read about each episode, the short version is that La Carmina and myself, with the help of several long-time collaborators, did production, event planning, casting, translation, and location permits for episodes about Japanese subculture and body-modification. La Carmina hosted extensively on two of the segments, and I even appeared in a couple of spots 😊. The producers told us that these segments ended up being anchors for the show, and have ended up on title cards for recap and trailer videos of the series.

All of the segments that we made for Das Duell Um Die Welt were based on the singular travel culture journalism that [La Carmina](https://www.lacarmina.com) has been making since the early days of blogging. A brave, goth-hearted adventurer, La Carmina has been a first hand participant and organizer in many of Japan's hidden subcultures for years. When most people would still be processing what they just saw at an event, she is tirelessly collecting her most interesting tales (and photographs) to share with the world.
I'll write more about La Carmina in other project pages 🦇

Florida TV (the production company behind Joko Vs. Klaas) came to La Carmina after she had done several travel TV and commercial spots. Florida TV has consistently wanted to collaborate on featuring underground culture that La Carmina has written about.

## Japan: Klaas lässt sich Donut in die Stirn spritzen _Japan: Klaas has [a] Donut Injected Into His Forehead_

Our first "challenge" from DUDW occurred when Joko sent Klaas to an underground party in Tokyo where he experienced saline inflation in his head that was then pressed in to look like a donut or a bagel.

La Carmina was one of the first people to [report on this rare body-modifcation](https://www.lacarmina.com/pirates/bagelheads.php) when it was done at one or two queer-run fetish scene parties in Japan. And Florida wanted Klaas to take it on.
_To be clear, these saline inflations only happened a few times, and were really uncommon!! Not a trend, as has been reported on some sites._

He's wearing a pair of small, old-school looking headphones like and a white respirator mask. I think the headphones are probably Sennheiser PXC headphones.](donut-intro.jpg 'Watch the full segment on Youtube')

For this segment, we essentially arranged for this event to happen. Our long-time collaborator [Keroppy Maeda](https://www.instagram.com/keroppymaeda/) (\* Posts may be NSFW and have really intense body mod stuff!) who was part of the original "bagel-head" events assembled a crew of experienced body modders who were comfortable doing the procedure. We had our friend Mistress Maya - a shibari performer - tie Klaas up for fun.

We did all of the local arrangements, locations, and translation between crew and Japan staff, some of which is depicted humorously in the show.

![Screenshot from a montage scene where Klaas is having saline injected into his forehead. The camera is behind Klaas's head in the chair, and Asami, a Japanese body-modification expert with a black respirator mask and light blue mohawk, is checking the IV tube. Behind him, people mill about at the Decabar party, some kind of projector display and black-lights behind the bar illuminate the scene.](donut-party.jpg)

For this particular shoot, La Carmina was on a job in another country so I was the one on camera, guiding Klaas to his strange fate! Despite growing up around TV stuff, this absolutely isn't my expertise. Folks like Klaas and La Carmina make it look easy, but it's not. You can see in the video that I'm much more comfortable when I switch into Japanese translation mode and am not thinking about the camera so much 💕

![Still photo from filming Joko and Klaas' Canada episode. Joko and La Carmina are joking around at Granville island in Vancouver. They look like they've been laughing and dancing. Joko's mouth is open wide with a big smile at the camera and La Carmina is looking down with her arms up and out like she's completing a dance moove. The camera is close to them, so the Burrard street bridge and Vancouver apartments are big in the background, with the False Creek waters below.](mund-dance.jpg)

## Kanada: Jokos Mund wird zugenäht _Canada: Joko's Mouth is Sewn Shut_

As a "revenge" for the saline experience, Klaas sent Joko to beautiful Vancouver Canada, where he experienced an idyllic tour of the beaches and city views, courtesy of La Carmina. Again, our boy gets lured into an eerie back-channel of society where we introduce him to [Russ Foxx](https://www.russfoxx.com/) (\* Site contains images of intense body mod stuff!), a Vancouver resident and body modification artist who is pushing serious boundaries with techniques like subdermal implants and ear-pointing.

At the end of the day, we brought Joko to a spooky special event that La Carmina hosted to show off Joko's brave change.

So, off-camera, Russ offered to numb Joko's lips for the procedure, which is something most body modfication folks wouldn't do, and Joko said "no!" He went for the full-pain of multiple sutures through the mouth and worked with his mouth sewn shut for several hours! The show poked a lot of fun (no pun intended) but I think this was a very intense challenge for Joko.

![An eerily-lit photo inside Russ Foxx's body modification studio. Joko is on a doctor's table with his head facing us, but Russ Foxx's tattoed arms and glove hands obscure what is happening to Joko's face in the photo. Behind the table, La Carmina and a camera man with a bright, glowing light observe the procedure cooly.](mund-stitch.jpg)

Since the Canada segment was in English, I wasn't as involved in the behind-the-scenes production. I still worked on location setup and designed a poster for the spooky event that flashes by ominously during the show. I'm really grateful I got to visit with La Carmina in Vancouver on this one. Our time together influenced a couple of paintings I did later.

![Soft acrylic on white paper painting in blue and warmish ochre. The painting at first seems to be a high, far angle of La Carmina at home, petting a fluffy scottish-fold cat, but the doorway behind her leads to an a row of airplane seats, and there's a traffic pole coming out of the ground. The floor below La Carmina has an art-nouveau illustration of a big flower with lots of flowing, spiny roots. In front of her is a guest on the couch, but we do not see their face, only a sweeping asymmetrical hair-cut and interesting outfit, that of a performer maybe.](mund-family.jpg)

![Another soft acrylic painting on white paper with a hyper-real image, painted mostly with purples and greens. Joko is in the front with his lips sewn shut. Behind him, figures dance like they're at a party, but they all kind of look like mannequins that are striped and covered in words that are all in different languages. Behind that are some buildings looming with a lot of pipes and tubes, and even higher, a city of wide-capped mushrooms blooms out of the city skyline. Next to the mushrooms is a large portrait of DJ Evilyn with a comic word balloon coming pointing to her mouth, but nothing is in the word balloon.](mund-last-minute.jpg)

Steven is performing on stage at Tokyo's Kinema Club as "Ralph Acapulco," dressed in a hot-pink suit with fishnets, leather straps, and chains. He raises his fist while he finishes the song. A backup band of custom-made Kaiju suit monsters can be seen behind him. One monster, "Becos" is a blue and yellow guy with a wide head and yellow horns. He has a wide, sausage shaped mouth with big triangular teeth and a huge tongue hanging out that droops below his electric guitar. On drums is "Gachachin" who is made to look like the Japanese TV character. Gachapin is a green, bucktoothed dinosaur who is known for looking kind of phallic. Gachachin is pink skin-toned and looks even more phallic, but the top of his head is obscured by Steven's pose. The shot is a low-angle with a thrust stage extending out towards us. A big crowd flanks the stage, with some folks raising their phones to take pictures or video.](steven-stage.jpg)

## Japan: ein Metal-Schlager-Lied performen _Japan: Perform a Hit Metal Song_

As of 2018, Joko and Klaas have started sending other German celebrities on travel-challenges as part of a new team battle. La Carmina and I worked on the first episode of this new chapter of their show: "Team Joko Gegen Team Klaas (Team Joko Vs. Team Klaas)" with Steven Gätjen, a TV host and broadcaster who is well-known in Germany.

Steven's episode was especially cinematic. The challenge this time was focused on bravery and performance. And, to be honest, it felt like La Carmina's and my abilities were being challenged to arrange a fully-casted musical stage act and several on-location events.

La Carmina also has [clips and a full article about the episode](https://lacarmina.com/blog/2018/11/weird-japan-travel-tv-show-host-steven-gatjen/) (\* Note this show is pretty NSFW by American TV standards!).

The segment begins in a traditional Japanese house (called a 古民家 "kominka" in Japanese) where Steven is served tea by four people in traditional dress before learning about his mission. This entire scene and location was planned and cast by La Carmina and me as part of a last-minute request, and I think we had maybe 48 hours to do it? We were saved by Ryuichi Ichinokawa, who we had previously collaborated with on [another show about Japanese "rent-a-family-member" businesses](https://lacarmina.com/blog/2014/02/host-boys-clubs-shinjuku-hostess-cafes/).

La Carmina was Steven's on-camera guide to his challenge in Tokyo: To perform a song on stage from a mashup of German musical styles - [pop schlager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlager_music) and industrial metal. She introduces Steven to five Japanese performers, two of which are wearing custom kaiju monster suits, who agreed to be part of the cast.

![Moody photo of Steven in the entrance-way to Department H/Tokyo Kinema Club. Steven is on the far left of the photo, facing left but turning his head around to look at us with a face of smoky eye-makeup. Behind him are 6 in-built illuminated window display cases that sweep around the front ticket area at Kinema club. They're placed unevenly and look like long capsules like something that would be in a 1970's sci-fi spaceship design. There's a retro deco-ish looking sign hanging from the ceiling that reads "東京キネマ倶楽部 (Tokyo Kinema Club) Ticket Front." Behind Steven to the left is a 2-3 foot tall plastic statue of the hot-rod art character "Rat Fink." The Rat part of the statue is white and looks like it might glow in the dark.](steven_setup-steven.jpg)

![A closer up photo of the long display cases, this time at an edge where the display cases all stack up and end with big rounded corners. Below them is another more conventional metal, rectangular display case. The display cases are all empty and the bottom one has a mirror completely covering the back of the case. The photo is at a dutch angle and in the mirror is gasp! It's me!!](steven_setup-naomi.jpg)
:::

At the end, we had Steven perform on stage at a massive, real fetish and cosplay party run by drag queens each month in Tokyo. For this portion of the show alone we had to work with the event organizers for filming permissions and camera setup, and also figure out how to rent an entire setup of musical instruments for the band to play on camera.

This episode was incredibly stressful and involved a lot of tears.
Still, looking back I'm full of a weird pride that we made it all work. Everyone at Florida TV was wildly creative, sometimes to a frustrating degree, but also kind and understanding to the people who we filmed. This is not an everyday combination for TV. I hope it comes out in the production.
